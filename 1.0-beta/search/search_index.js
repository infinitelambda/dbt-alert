It is not intended as a guide for using <code>dbt-alert</code>, and some pieces assume a level of familiarity with Python development with <code>poetry</code>. Specific code snippets in this guide assume you are using macOS or Linux and are comfortable with the command line.</p> <ul> <li>Branches: All pull requests from community contributors should target the <code>main</code> branch (default). If the change is needed as a patch for a minor version of dbt that has already been released (or is already a release candidate), a maintainer will backport the changes in your PR to the relevant \"latest\" release branch (<code>1.0.&lt;latest&gt;</code>, <code>1.1.&lt;latest&gt;</code>, ...). If an issue fix applies to a release branch, that fix should be first committed to the development branch and then to the release branch (rarely release-branch fixes may not apply to <code>main</code>).</li> <li>Releases: Before releasing a new minor version, we prepare a series of beta release candidates to allow users to test the new version in live environments. This is an important quality assurance step, as it exposes the new code to a wide variety of complicated deployments and can surface bugs before official release. Releases are accessible via pip.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributing.html#getting-the-code","title":"Getting the code","text":""},{"location":"contributing.html#installing-git","title":"Installing git","text":"<p>You will need <code>git</code> in order to download and modify the <code>dbt-alert</code> source code.
